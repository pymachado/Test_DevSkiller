address smart contract on Ropsten network: 0xb36ac281b262ecce804a6be0cf5adb80306edd56
------------------------------------------
There are two deploy for the same bytecode from the same address (my address), the verifying process did not work, for this reason I just let a github repo with the code only to verify on Remix IDE https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Thanks.
